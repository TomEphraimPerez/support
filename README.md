Apple, including state laws requires information on how to contact me via URL for LCTO-14 support.
<br />
My website for support is here at **https://TomEphraimPerez.github.io/support/**
<br />
On another note re; privacy:
I, nor this app - "LCTO-14", nor anyone else, nor any other entity whatsoever, DOES NOT COLLECT ANY DATA from any user, ever.
<br />
<br />
**A guick usage guide**:
<br />
• Introduction
<br />
This app is for the common-good, and is an app that helps shoppers help other shoppers from being fooled.
This is done by searching, and/or posting a certain grocery product. Say for sake of argument, it's called "myProduct100".
Since the iCloud database is practically emtpy (300+ records of various grocery products as of 9-27-24) initially upon deployment of this app,
there will be few products that can be searched. SO - 
PLEASE help fellow shoppers make the right choice for them to be satisfied with their purchases and not being taken for a fool.
<br />
**• Usage**
<br />
In the lower portion of the app's landing screen, shopper_A can Comment on myProduct100.
This is kind of shopper_A to do so, especially if myProduct100 was never input into the system (database) by anyone. 
Now, thanks to shopper_A, anyone else (in the US) that's searching for product_A will find myProduct100 
by way of the kind effort of the Commenting by shopper_A.
<br />
BTW - the "Comment" contains 3 parts that shopper_A filled in - 
<br />
1/3) "POST the product, stars, comments"
<br />
2/3) "Enter number of stars (0-5)"
<br />
3/3) "Comment here. Tap any bottle to POST" †
<br />
† The background of the landing page depicts rows of kitchen cleaning † items (the bottles).
When done Commenting (product name, number of stars given, thoughts on it), tap any bottle to POST.
The commenter/critic will tap on the screen of bottles, and see that the keypad will close, revealing the "POST Comment" button.

<br />
*Now that shopper-A was kind enough to take 45 sec to help others by entering an otherwise
unsearchable product, other shoppers searching for myProduct100 can now see how myProduct100
performs, or tastes, or looks, if you will.

<br />
At the moment, 88 characters are permitted into the comment section, and there's a counter on the screen.
There are 2 buttons
<br />
1/2) Search_Product, and
<br />
2/2) POST comment
<br />

<br />
**• Closing thoughts**
<br />
More features are on the way once I or we populate the iCloud DB with products.
Please be generous and respectful, and help fellow shoppers make the right choice for them on their purchases. 
TBA: COMPARISON feature. Via pictures ("BEFORE" and "AFTER") of for example - the front of the container box 
(eg., a box of frozen burritos, pizza, etc) or even a TV ad (eg., of a hamburger of a large fast food chain), and 
COMPARE THAT TO - 
WHAT YOU REALLY GET!
