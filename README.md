Apple and state laws requires information on how to contact me via URL for LCTO-14 support.
My website for support is https://TomEphraimPerez.github.io/support/

On another note re; privacy:
I, nor this app - "LCTO-14", nor anyone else, nor any other entity whatsoever, DOES NOT COLLECT ANY DATA from any user, ever.

A guick usage guide:
• Introduction
This app is for the common-good, and is an app that helps shoppers help other shoppers.
This is done by posting a grocery product. Say for sake of argument, it's called "myProduct100".
Since the cloud database is practically emtpy initially upon deployment of this app to the public,
there will be few products that can be searched. 
Please help fellow shoppers make the right choice for them to be satisfied with their purchases.
• Usage
In the lower portion of the app's landing screen, shopper_A can comment on myProduct100.
This will be a kind gesture of shopper-A, since shopper-A searched for it upon launching LCTO-14,
but the app returned a message saying that there's nothing for myProduct100 in the cloud DB yet.
The comment contains 3 parts that shopper-A fills in - 
1/3) "Enter the product here"
2/3) "Enter your star rating (0-5)**", and the bottom textfield,
3/3) "Enter your comment here"
** just type in numbers 0-5 inclusive.
•
Now that shopper-A was kind enough to take a minute to help others by entering an otherwise
unsearchable product, other shoppers searching for myProduct100 can now see how myProduct100
performs, if you will.
•
At the moment, 88 characters are permitted into the comment section, and there's a counter.
There are 2 buttons
1/2) Search_Product, and
2/2) Post comment
•
• Closing thoughts
More features are on the way, once I and we, all pitch in to populate the Apple cloud DB.
Please be generous and respectful of others, and help fellow shoppers make the right choice
for them to be satisfied with their purchases.
